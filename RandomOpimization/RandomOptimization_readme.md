The source code is originally from ABAGAIL package developped by Pushkar Kolhe. Some codes are modified under src/opt/test/
1. AdultdataTest.java is based on AdaloneTest.java. The different include loading training set and testing set data separately. And modify the input layers and hidden layers to commondate with new dataset. The new dataset is called "Student_Math_clean_dummies_train.csv" and "Student_Math_clean_dummies_test.csv". And it is also attached and will be called by this java script. 
2. FourPeaksTest_MMZ.java is based on FourPeaksTest.java with the modification of adding multiple level of control parameters for each random optimization algorithms to find the optimal maximum. Also add time checker for each training. 
3. CountOnesTest2.java is based on CountOnes.java. The change is similar to FourPeaksTest_MMZ.java. I.e. adding multiple level of control parameters for each random optimization algorithms to find the optimal maximum. Also add time checker for each training. 
4. KnapsackTest_MMZ.java is based on KnapsackTest.java with similar modification like #2 and #3 above.
