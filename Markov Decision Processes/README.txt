#OMSCS: Machine Learning - Assignment 4 
##Minming Zhao


The purpose of this readme file is to offer the reader the steps required to make use of this BURLAP machine learning package with several of my own custom classes (included) and Eclipse (not included). This readme is split by the different Markov Decision Processes that were required for completion of the assignment. The instructions below will assume that you have already successfully downloaded and opened Eclipse.

#Running the Grid World: Easy Version:

1. While inside the directory structure burlap-assignment-4/src/burlap/assignment4/ right-click on the EasyGridWorldLauncher_MZ.
2. Go to the “Run As…” section and select “Java Application".
3. All three algorithms will run and the aggregate analysis and optimal policies will be printed to the console.

#Running the Grid World: Complex Version:

1. While inside the directory structure burlap-assignment-4/src/burlap/assignment4/ right-click on the HardGridWorldLauncher_MZ.
2. Go to the “Run As…”n section and select “Java Application".
3. All three algorithms will run and the aggregate analysis and optimal policies will be printed to the console.
